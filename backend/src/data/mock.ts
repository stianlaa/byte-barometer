      "Not for very much longer outside of insulated markets like Japan and central Italy where big cars physically will not fit the streets. In the UK for example nearly half of all cars on the road now are SUVs or CUVs which are inherently larger than their hatchback counterparts regardless of what size and tax class they&#x27;re weaseled into. Two of the best selling cars there in 2022 were the Kia Sportage and Nissan Qashqai, both compact CUVs with Nissan having completely dropped hatchback offering in that size class. In the EU and U.S. crash regulations have dictated cars be wider to accommodate side-impact airbags and side-sill reinforcement bars on doors, while hoods grow taller to adhere to pedestrian impact regulations. In China it&#x27;s starting to be seen as unsightly or lower class to still be clinging to an A or B-class city or subcompact car, and so the market has trended towards mid-sizers. Combine this with the small car profit problem, and cars like the Ford Fiesta and Kia Picanto won&#x27;t be around for very much longer. Ford&#x27;s already discontinuing the Fiesta this year with no announced replacement.",

      "I was surprised to see Cars listed as one of the ones that people generally hate. I’m a little biased because my son absolutely adored that movie, and I have fond memories of him taking his Lightning McQueen toy around with him everywhere. But over <i>many</i> repeated watchings both my wife and I agreed it was a quality production.<p>It has a good cast with Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt, Paul Newman, and even Larry the Cable Guy puts in a pretty decent performance. The minor characters are charming, too (including George Carlin and Cheech Marin).<p>The story is fairly timeless and reminiscent of Doc Hollywood. I don’t know how they manage to make it work so well with anthropomorphic cars, but somehow they do. The main character has a good arc, and there’s a good amount of nostalgia. I don’t think I ever cried, but I definitely felt something - which is more than I can say for the Cars sequels.<p>Would I go and watch it now without kids? No. But Pixar put out a movie that entertained kids and adults alike. Earned $462 million at the box office. Made an absolute killing in merchandise sales (and I thought the toys were pretty high quality, especially the die cast Tomica cars here in Japan). I have a lot of respect for what they were able to do with Cars. Not so much for the sequels, though.<p>They also call Monsters University a mediocre sequel, but I tend to prefer it over Monsters Inc. Pretty much for the same reasons as Cars - good cast, timeless story reminiscent of Revenge of the Nerds, and my kids loved it.",

      "They lost because tge winner of that generation was the Wii, wich won because of it&#x27;s gimmicky motion controller and good library of party games. Something simmilar is happening now with thw Switch. In both cases, being much cheaper doesn&#x27;t hurt.<p>But compared to the Xbox, PS3 &quot;won&quot; at the tail end of the generation, I would credit this to the supperior exclusive titles and the sales outside US. In Europe, Japan an South America, Playstation sells a lot more than Xbox. Where I live (Brazil) almost no one buys Xbox. As an anecdote, in 20 years, I met only one person who owned one (a X360) and several who had Playstations. And the X360 owner only had it because she worked at Microsoft and got it as a gift from the company.",

      "This is an example of &quot;normalization of excellence&quot;.<p>A modern car has several thousand moving parts, high temperatures, high pressures, an oxidizing environment, and is subjected to potholes and wide temperature swings.   That it is expected to survive 200K miles is a miracle.<p>Before the model T, a car that would last 20K miles was a considered a reliable car.  The model T pushed those expectations up to 50K.   Post-war expectations increased to 100K and the Japanese pushed expectations this millenia to 200K.<p>At the same time that lifetimes went up, maintenance went down.   You used to have to regularly inspect tune and replace stuff like timing chains, spark plugs and seals.<p>A couple of comparisons: a computer fan has an expected lifetime of 10 years, and it&#x27;s way simpler than a car.   A fighter jet needs 16 hours of maintenance for every 1 in the sky.",
